RAP Rules:
%br
1. Each week, select as many players as you want with an imaginary budget of $50. (You must pick at least 1)
%br
%br
2. This year, like in hoops, you are allowed to select the same combination of players as someone else. Duplicate entries will be ranked in order of the time they were posted. (Play fair! Remember that any picks that are edited will be disqualified).
%br
%br
3. You accumulate RAP points based on the stats your players rack up (see scoring table below). Points are then earned for Top 20 finishes each game. 1st place will get you 20 points, on down to 1 point for a 20th place finish. The overall standings are updated each week, and whoever is atop the standings after the final game will be declared the 2008 Football Champion.
%br
%br
4. DO NOT EDIT YOUR PICKS *edited picks are automatically disqualified, that includes editing your picks because you went over the $50 limit, this is simple math, it shouldn't be a problem!*
%br
%br
5. Leftover money does NOT count for additional points.
%br
%br
6. If you accidently overprice (chose $60 worth of players instead of $50), disqualified, simple math... simple simple math...
%br
%br
ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:
%br
%br
1. Prices will be updated no later earlier than 48 hours prior to game and no later than 24 hours to game.
%br
2. Players are not carried over from week-to-week.
%br
3. Standings will be updated within 72 hours (usually earlier) of the final score of the game (unless otherwise noted). IF I don't get standings out on time, don't bother me until 72 hours after the time hits 0:00 of the game

What is the Tie-Breaker: Total points scored for both teams. So, if you think Arizona will beat their opponent 41-17, your Tie-Breaker would be "TB=58".

Tie-Breaker Procedures for RAP:
%br
%br
1) Prices for both football and basketball will be out approximately 48 hours before the game.
%br
2) Original pickset gets most points in overall standings.
%br
3) Copycat picksets will place after that according to the tiebreaker.
%br
4) Original picksets in rap head-to-head match will always beat copycat picksets.
%br
5) If both posters in rap league are copycat posters of another poster (and not an original pickset, IE: if uofacat23 and bison79 are playing head to head and both copy merkin), first come, first serve wins.
%br
6) In overall standings, if two unique picksets tie, they will both get the same amount of points in standings.
%br
7) In rap league, if both picksets are unique and tie, tiebreaker determines winner.
%br
8) In any event, if the tiebreaker cannot break a tie (IE both players pick the same score), first come, first serve wins. Or if both posters pick the same distance from actual score (over or under), first come first serve wins.
